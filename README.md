## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used tailwind for the very first time in this project so I'll say I learned how tailwind css works and it's benefits over vanilla css.

```html
<h1 className="bg-gray-100 hover:bg-blue transition-all duration-75">
  Some HTML code I'm proud of
</h1>
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue building more projects with tailwind css as I think It will help me go back and learn some css quirks too. All in for this one.

### Useful resources

- [The Official Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I've got to say, these docs are absolutely fire. For real. It was immensely helpful in my learning process. Prop to the people behind this :)
- [Thirus on YT(YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuY9MehvHh4) - This channel and this video in particular was really helpful in learning how to apply the Css Grid system in tailwind css. Great Channel.
